We use resources for 2 things: Firstly, to store the different 4-stone combinations as a matrix, which is then passed on to an int[][][] Array with corresponding information. 
They are our 4 stone "types".Each Number is translated to a different color.
Secondly,The Result of the Enumeration is written in the Enumeration text file ,which can then be read to visualize it.
How it is embedded in the code will be explained on their respective positions.
